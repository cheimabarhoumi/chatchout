# ChatChout Authentication and API Implementation

## Complete Authentication Solution for Vercel Deployment

This document explains the comprehensive authentication implementation for deploying ChatChout on Vercel's serverless platform.

## Architecture Overview

We've created a specialized serverless authentication system with these key components:

1. **Individual API Handlers**: Each endpoint has its own dedicated handler file
2. **Authentication Middleware**: A reusable authentication module that works with serverless functions
3. **Database Connection Management**: Each handler manages its own connection to MongoDB
4. **CORS Protection**: Every handler has built-in CORS protection
5. **Consistent Error Handling**: Standardized error responses across all handlers

## Authentication Flow

### 1. Registration (fixed-register.js)

- Accepts user registration data (name, email, password)
- Validates required fields
- Creates new user in the database
- Returns JWT token and user data

### 2. Login (improved-login.js)

- Accepts email and password
- Verifies credentials against the database
- Updates user's online status
- Returns JWT token and user data

### 3. Authentication Middleware (auth-middleware-new.js)

- Extracts token from Authorization header
- Verifies token signature
- Finds user in the database
- Adds user to request object
- Works in both standard middleware and serverless function contexts

### 4. Logout (improved-logout.js)

- Authenticates the user
- Updates user's online status to offline
- Updates last seen timestamp

## API Implementation

### 1. User Search (improved-users-search.js)

- Authenticates the user
- Searches for users by name or email
- Returns matched users with pagination

### 2. Chats List (improved-chats-list.js)

- Authenticates the user
- Retrieves the user's chat conversations
- Populates participants and last message
- Returns chats with pagination

## Common Issues and Solutions

### 1. CORS Issues

All handlers use the `allowCors` wrapper to ensure proper CORS headers are sent. Additionally, the `vercel.json` file includes global CORS headers for all routes.

### 2. Authentication Token Handling

The authentication middleware now handles both formats of tokens:
- Tokens with `id` field (generated by our login handler)
- Tokens with `userId` field (used in some parts of the codebase)

### 3. Database Connection Management

Each handler establishes its own connection to MongoDB, with connection caching to prevent reconnecting on every request.

### 4. Error Handling

All handlers use consistent error response formats:
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "Descriptive error message",
  "error": "Detailed error in development mode only"
}
```

## Testing Authentication

A special test endpoint is provided at `/api/auth/test` to validate authentication is working correctly.

## Deployment Guidelines

1. Ensure all environment variables are set in Vercel
2. Deploy the updated codebase
3. Test the full authentication flow:
   - Register a new user
   - Login with the new user
   - Test protected endpoints (user search, chats list)
   - Test logout functionality

## Troubleshooting

If authentication issues persist, check:
1. Vercel logs for detailed error messages
2. JWT secret is correctly set in environment variables
3. MongoDB connection string is valid
4. Frontend is sending the token in the correct format
