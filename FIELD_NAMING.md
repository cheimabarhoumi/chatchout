# Authentication Field Handling

## User Model Structure
After examining the MongoDB database, we confirmed the User model has:
- A required `name` field
- No `username` field (contrary to what was initially assumed)
- Standard fields like `email`, `password`, `avatar`, etc.

## Registration Implementation
We've updated the `fixed-register.js` handler to:
1. Accept requests from the frontend with the `name` field
2. Create users with the proper fields that match the User model
3. Return the user data in the format expected by the frontend

## Login Implementation
We've created a `fixed-login.js` handler that:
1. Accepts login requests with email and password
2. Validates credentials against the User model
3. Updates the user's online status and last seen timestamp
4. Returns a JWT token and user data in the format expected by the frontend

## Best Practices Going Forward
When developing frontend and backend components:
1. Ensure that frontend form field names match the backend model field names
2. Document API contracts including required field names
3. Use validation on both ends to ensure data integrity
4. Consider using TypeScript interfaces/types shared between frontend and backend
5. Always check the database schema before implementing API handlers

## MongoDB Document Example
```json
{
  "_id": "...",
  "name": "User Name",
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "password": "hashed_password",
  "bio": "",
  "isOnline": false,
  "avatar": "https://ui-avatars.com/api/?name=User%20Name&background=3b82f6&color=fff&size=128",
  "lastSeen": "2025-08-01T10:08:38.277Z",
  "friends": [],
  "blockedUsers": [],
  "createdAt": "2025-08-01T10:08:38.282Z",
  "updatedAt": "2025-08-01T10:08:38.282Z"
}
```
