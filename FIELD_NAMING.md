# Field Naming in Frontend vs Backend

## Issue
We initially thought there was a mismatch between field naming conventions:
- Frontend uses `name` in the registration form
- Backend was expected to use `username` in the registration endpoint

However, after examining the User model, we discovered that:
- The User model only has a `name` field (not a `username` field)
- The frontend is correctly sending a `name` field
- The error occurred because we were trying to set a non-existent `username` field in the database

## Solution
We've updated the `fixed-register.js` handler to:
1. Only use the `name` field from the frontend request
2. Create the user with the appropriate fields that match the User model
3. Return the response with fields that match the model

### Implementation
The updated handler:
- Accepts requests from the frontend with the `name` field
- Validates and creates a user with the correct fields (`name`, `email`, `password`)
- Returns the user data in the format expected by the frontend

## Best Practices Going Forward
When developing frontend and backend components:
1. Ensure that the frontend form field names match the backend model field names
2. Document API contracts including required field names
3. Use validation on both ends to ensure data integrity
4. Consider using TypeScript interfaces/types shared between frontend and backend
5. Always check the database schema before implementing API handlers
